Sign languages are languages that use manual communication to convey meaning. This can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas.

This Project follows LeNet-5  CNN architecture.

2. The CNN model gives 80% accuracy on test data.

3. Loss vs Number of iterations looks like this-

6.Conclusion - 
	  Accuracy can be improved by tuning hyperparameters or using a different CNN architecture.
	  Regularization techniques can be used to improve accuracy.
